## Language Files

Language files are under ``src/main/resources/assets/viafabric/lang/``. Please edit ``.json`` files. Create a ``.lang``
with ``${nameofjson}``, so the build script can convert automatically to the old format.

Use capitalization rules from your language. Try to be consistent with Minecraft language files.

Please check in-game string length. Note that abbreviations may cause issues with the screen reader.

## Source Code
